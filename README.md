# Seismocardiogram
Hi. This repository is intended to store and share the materials used for a research on seismocardiogram. I hope these materials will help those who are eager to learn principles of seismocardiogram and methods used for cardiovascular disease detection.  


Since I am completely new to this area you can consider this repo as a learning pathway. I am going to share notebooks and update wiki regularly. You will have an access to all data Ä± have been using. In the wiki section, I will explain the data, and what is special about them. If time permits I will also explain all the funtions that I have used in the notebooks.

I hope you find this repo educative and fun.
